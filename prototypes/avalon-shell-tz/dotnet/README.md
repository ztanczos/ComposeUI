# ComposeUI Shell

This solution contains the ComposeUI shell for Windows.

# Usage


## Usage with `composeui-node-launcher`

The shell binaries must be globally accessible (ie. included in `PATH`) for `composeui-node-launcher` to work.

## Development setup

1. Build the solution
2. Run the `add-to-path.ps1` script to add the shell project's debug output directory to the user's PATH variable.
    This step is necessary to make the shell available as a global command.
